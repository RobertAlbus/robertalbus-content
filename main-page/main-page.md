## Hi! I'm Rob. 

I'm a cloud-native software developer from western Canada. 

#### Hackabout, creative coder, audio engineer. 

I am currently building a [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding) framework called Clover. It's for creating computer music, or more broadly, temporal sonic art. The core of the framework is a suite of classes for composing discrete time signal graphs synced to a sample clock.
