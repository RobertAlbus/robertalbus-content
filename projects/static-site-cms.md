Author your Hugo site with re-usable page components. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. Amazing speed and flexibility.

Composing a complex page from various re-usable components in Hugo is not supported out of the box. This Hugo theme bolts this functionality into the framework with a bit of clever metaprogramming.
