A supernova explosion of code and music production. The weekend that I started this project I spent about 40 hours across three days. Countless hours since.

I'm going to replace this toy portfolio website with something a more well suited to long-format writing for Clover. Until then: C++, sample clock, declarative signal graphs, extensible base classes for custom graph nodes, code-based composition tools, MIDI, and the future may very well include a video component.
