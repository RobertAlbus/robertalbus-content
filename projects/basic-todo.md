#### Angular To-Do App
This mobile responsive to-do application allows users to create task items with a title, description, and completion status. Users can also delete, complete, and uncomplete task items.

Notable features:
* Local storage for persistence across sessions
* Hosted using Amazon Web Services S3 static website hosting

Shortcomings:
* Local storage persistence does not work cross-device by nature
* Layout would benefit from a framework like Bootstrap's grid
* state management is rather primitive in this application
