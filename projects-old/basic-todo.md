@@@ DESCRIPTION
A simple browser-based to-do application that uses local storage for persistence across sessions.
@@@

@@@ DISPLAY

This mobile responsive to-do application allows users to create task items with a title, description, and completion status. Users can also delete, complete, and uncomplete task items.

Notable features:
* Local storage for persistence across sessions that is unique to a given browser
* Hosted using Amazon Web Services S3 static website hosting

Opportunities for improvement:
* Use a UI framework to speed up development
* Use Trello. All jokes aside, the purpose of this project was to learn a new tool rather than create an effective to-do application.
